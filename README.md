	This project is a set of mini games for logic.
	At startup, we get to the activity selection menu. We are expected to enter the activity number to launch it.

	When choosing 1, we just say hello.																https://asciinema.org/a/UN85Ukdcjhl2Pu2SBEEYODv5l
	
	When choosing 2, we get into the game of checking the parity of the number.
	Here we need to answer 'yes' if the number is even and 'no' in the opposite case. In case of an error, we will be informed about it.				https://asciinema.org/a/4rvQQ3gVN0IInxhPvGmB0xQXf

	When choosing 3, we get into the calculator game.
	Here we have to be in the role of a calculator. It is necessary to perform calculations and record the result. In case of an error, we will be notified.	https://asciinema.org/a/xezMBFPR8A5FRdB6PD29VJjys

	When choosing 4, we get into the game by finding GCD.
	Here we need to find the smallest common divisor for the two transmitted numbers and write it down. In case of an error, we will be notified.			https://asciinema.org/a/HCI6YXaQr20I7TnmigvAg1mOh

	When choosing 5, we get into the progression game.
	Here we need to calculate the missing element of the progression and write it down. If we make a mistake we will be notified.					https://asciinema.org/a/TCjjf5RBORGkRZUIDvpv9LcWp

	When choosing 6, we get into the Prime game.
	Here we need to determine whether the transmitted number is prime. It is necessary to answer 'yes' if the number is prime and 'no' in the opposite case.
If we make a mistake of an error, we will be notified.															https://asciinema.org/a/dLVyuZ8RmolNfoVmew9nZJYoi
	
	If you are bored with us, just press 0.																https://asciinema.org/a/JNVLFRoedna4JVprS3NIuPfdX
